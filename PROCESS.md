# Technical exercise process

Someone from our team will grant you access to a private Github repo at a time that's been pre-arranged with you. The
repo will contain the instructions with the problem's description.

**Duration**: You should work on the exercise for no more than 3 hours, but you may split this over non-consecutive sessions.

## Guidance

- **Treat the codebase as your own**. Do not feel constrained in parts of the repository you can edit. You are welcome
  to make any changes to the layout, structure, code (or anything else) that you see as a priority.
- **Read the docs**. The exercise repository will contain documentation which will make your life easier!
- **Ensure you have internet access**. The exercise is open-book, and you'll likely find online resources useful. 
- **Prioritise demonstrating an overall solution**, rather than devoting too much time to fixing little problems at
  runtime. Bear in mind that to provide a comprehensive solution to the exercise might take longer than the allotted
  time. In our evaluation, we are not focused on each detail working perfectly. We are more interested to see an
  end-to-end solution/scaffold focusing on aspects like usability, flexibility, extensibility, maintainability etc.

## Process

Before the exercise:

- You should have access to this Primer Repo.
- You should have provided Cookpad with your Github username.
- You should have arranged a date and time for the exercise.

The start of the exercise:

- Just before the arranged time, your Github user will receive an invitation to a private repository containing the
  Exercise. Keep an eye on your e-mails and Github account.

During the exercise:

- **IMPORTANT:** Once you have access, you should **immediately fork** the repository. This way we can make sure that
  there won't be any technical issues later for pushing the solution. You should ensure your fork is a **private
  repository** (this is the default Github behaviour).
- You should work on the problem for no more than 3 hours in total. An incremental Git commit history is encouraged but
  not required.

To submit the exercise:

- Create a Pull Request from your fork back to the original Cookpad repository. We can only consider commits that you
  send us, so **don't forget to push your final commits**! If you prefer to create the pull request to the repo
  immediately, before beginning work on the solution, that is also fine. We won't review it until you let us know
  you're done.

## Follow up

We'll confirm that we have received your Pull Request and then the team will review your submission. We'll do our best
to be in touch within a working day of your submission to let you know the outcome and to discuss any possible next
steps.
